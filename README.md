# Introspect

Introspect is an idea that occured to me during a self-analysis process that I took part of. I found it helpful to break down my goals into tiny steps and get an overview on where I stand towards their completion.

The purpose of Introspect is just that: to provide a place where we can set our goals and the steps that we need to do in order to achieve them.
